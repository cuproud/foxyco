/// Reads a Lyft Driver offer card (references/bug1 (1).jpg, new (3)-(5).jpg).
///
/// Lyft is the worst offender for false positives (HANDOFF bugs 2, 3, 4): its
/// online/home screen is a MAP covered in "$N Lyft · M min away" pickup bubbles
/// and a "$37.64 | 3" Turbo/streak banner at the very top, plus a "Ride Finder"
/// list of SUGGESTED SCHEDULED RIDE cards. The old parser grabbed the banner
/// number and stitched two scheduled legs into a fake trip.
///
/// The strict offer-detection contract kills all of that:
///   • **Accept required** — a real card (bug1 (1)) has an `Accept` button; the
///     browse map has `Go Online` / `Ride Finder` and no Accept.
///   • **browse markers rejected** — `Ride Finder`, `wait in your area`,
///     `min away` (the map bubbles), `scheduled ride`, `Go Online`, etc.
///   • **exactly two km legs** — the map bubbles carry NO "km", so they aren't
///     legs; a scheduled-ride list has more than two.
///
/// Card anchors (all clauses must hold, else `null` — fail safe):
///   • payout — first clean `$N`; the `Incl. CA$X bonus` and `$Y/hr est. rate`
///     lines are skipped by [ParserPatterns.findPayout].
///   • two `N min · X km` legs — pickup first, dropoff last (timeline order).
